MessageToDisplayOnInstallation=This package requires the R system to be installed on your\n\
 computer before it can be used. Before using this package you must manually install\n\
 the R package "rJava" by typing install.packages("rJava") from the R console.\n\
 Furthermore, the environment variable R_HOME must be set to point to the installation\n\
 directory for R and the R executable must be in the PATH environment variable.\n\
 This package will attempt to locate the JRI native library (which is installed\n\
 as part of rJava) automatically under Windows and Mac OS X. For this to succeed\n\
 under Windows it is necessary for the R_LIBS_USER environment variable to be set to point\n\
 to the user's personal R packages directory. Alternatively, the jri.native.library\n\
 java property can be set to point directly to the jri native library file, or the\n\
 java.library.path can be set to point to the directory that contains the jri native\n\
 library file. More information on configuring Java to access JRI under various OS\n\
 can be found at http://www.rforge.net/JRI/\n\n\
 Example Knowledge Flow template files demonstrating the R components can be found in\n\
 ${WEKA_HOME}/packages/RPlugin/templates.
